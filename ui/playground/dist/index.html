<p>
  It appears you are trying to access the <em>Smart Core Playground UI</em> via <code>go get</code> or via
  <code>go build</code> output, this does not work out of the box.
</p>

<p>Don't panic, you have some options</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Download the playground application from the project
    <a href="https://github.com/smart-core-os/sc-playground/releases">releases</a> page.
    This includes the full Playground UI, built and updated as part of each release. <b>Recommended</b>
  </li>
  <li>
    Run the UI manually from source. Clone the <a href="https://github.com/smart-core-os/sc-playground">repository</a>
    and follow the instructions in the <code>ui/playground</code> directory. This is useful for local development of the
    playground itself but might have issues if the server and ui are different versions.
  </li>
</ol>
